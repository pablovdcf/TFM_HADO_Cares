HADO CARES: Healthcare Data Analysis with Kedro
</h1>

## Overview

`HADO_CARES` embarks on a meticulous journey through healthcare data, utilizing the Kedro framework to orchestrate a coherent, insightful, and reproducible data science workflow. From initial data scrutiny to implementing sophisticated machine learning models, this project threads through various stages of data analysis, offering a structured, transparent, and replicable methodology encapsulated in a series of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

#### Context and Problem

The HADO area of the Santiago de Compostela hospital especialized in paliative cares, manages patient records, among other ways, manually using Excel spreadsheets. This methodology, although functional, leads to a lack of standardization in data formats and limited utilization of the collected information, further hampered by the absence of an efficient system to process and analyze the data in a comprehensive and cohesive manner.


### Objectives

The main objective of this project is to enhance the current patient monitoring process in HADO by:
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) with a special focus on primary diagnostics.
- Identifying trends and classifying high-cardinality variables.
- Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and modeling techniques to group and classify variables.
- Creating an application for visualizing the transformed and analyzed data, thus assisting in the decision-making process of HADO professionals.

## [Kedro Pipelines](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/tree/main/hado/src)

### 1.Data Preprocessing Pipeline
The data preprocessing pipeline is defined in [data_preprocessing/pipeline.py](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/src/hado/pipelines/data_preprocessing/pipeline.py) and involves several nodes, such as `check_convert_and_concat(**dataframes)`, which are defined in [data_preprocessing/nodes.py](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/src/hado/pipelines/data_preprocessing/nodes.py). Parameters are configured in [data_preprocessing.yml](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/conf/base/parameters/data_preprocessing.yml).

  
   Through different files I normalize, rename, remove outliers from the columns through the parameters of the file `data_preprocessing.yml` and finally concat them to work with only a unique DataFrame.

### 2.Data Processing Pipeline
The data processing pipeline, defined in [data_processing/pipeline.py](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/src/hado/pipelines/data_processing/pipeline.py), includes nodes like `clean_text(df: pd.DataFrame)` and `replace_missing(df: pd.DataFrame, params: Dict)`, which are defined in [data_processing/nodes.py](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/src/hado/pipelines/data_processing/nodes.py). Parameters are set in [data_processing.yml](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/conf/base/parameters/data_processing.yml).

New variables are added through the data such as the different drugs used as `morphine`, the values for the health scales are classified, a replacement and mapping is done through lists and dictionaries for different variables and a clean DataFrame and another one with One-Hot encoding is prepared for later use in the notebooks and modeling.

### 3.Data Science Pipeline
The data science pipeline, defined in [data_science/pipeline.py](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/src/hado/pipelines/data_science/pipeline.py), encompasses nodes like `preprocess_split_data(data: pd.DataFrame, parameters)`, `train_clf_model(X_train: pd.DataFrame, y_train: pd.Series, model_options: Dict[str, Any])`, and more, which are defined in [data_science/nodes.py](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/src/hado/pipelines/data_science/nodes.py). Parameters are configured in 
[data_science.yml](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/conf/base/parameters/data_science.yml)


Finally, the classification models are run through Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM to see which one gives the best result and pass it through the parameters as the best classification model. The confusion matrices are also extracted. For more details go to [data_science.yml](https://github.com/pablovdcf/TFM_HADO_Cares/blob/main/hado/conf/base/parameters/data_science.yml).
